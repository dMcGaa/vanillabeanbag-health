* Broiled salmon covered with shrimp in a butter sauce, asparagus, and a salad
* Bowl of: shredded coconut, handful of almonds, teaspoon of cocoa powder, teaspoon of stevia, handful of raspberries.
* Coffee with a tablespoon of coconut oil.
* Crack slaw - steam a bag of broccoli slaw mix and stir into a pound of browned 70% lean hamburger (add jalapeno if you like spicy).  Season with asian spices (soy sauce, fish sauce, siracha), or hot sauce, or anything else that sounds good to you and is low carb.
* Browned hamburger with fresh mushrooms and a can of low carb coconut cream.  Reduce until the sauce is thick.  Season with curry.
* Mashed cauliflower instead of potatoes.  Steam it and pulverise in a food processor along with cream cheese, regular chees (cheddar), and bacon (and the grease).
